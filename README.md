## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn to build a responsive site, 


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media only screen and (max-width: xxxpx) {

  }
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue with responsive website, usine @media queries for variable devices: phones, tablets, laptop and desktop.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - This helped me for responsive website. This pattern is very usefull and the page MDN very clear.
